Hey y'all, I'm Daniel! I'm a Software Engineer at Crunchyroll in Chișinău, Moldova. I started my coding journey early in the last year of high school when I got the occasion to learn and work at a small local startup, VS Art. For about a year and a half, I've been doing some freelance projects and static themes for the Themeforest marketplace. 

Next, I landed on another small local startup, Fruitware. During nine months, I worked on a variety of small projects, mostly Front-end but also some PHP for CRUD admins and a browser extension for Yandex. 

After that, I landed at Amdaris and worked there for about three years. Besides helping other teams with the UI work and maintaining some older projects, I've been the main Front-end developer for a new project. We built a data analytics platform focused on ease of reading the data using colorful, custom charts. 

Finally, Crunchyroll, the place where fun/entertainment meets work. It's a lot of joy to work here, especially as I'm a fan of anime and manga myself. Here I work on maintaining and developing Crunchyroll which often includes some PHP adjustemnts, maintaining and developing the VRV web app and some internal projects.
For the latest 2-3 years, the main focus of the company, and so my work to, has been the beta version of the Crunchyroll web app. It is a result of some reused VRV code, including parts of the components library, and adjusted to the new requirments and designs. My most contributions are to the internal components library that's uset for Beta CR. It involves creating new components, adjusting old ones to the new design and creating an infrastructure that allows for fast and independent development from the main up but also, the option to use it as a standalone components library by other teams.
Some of the places that you can notice my work is the homepage, with the HeroCarousel and other feed Carousels, created from scratch, mostly with CSS and minimal JS. The background and user avatar modals from the profile page. The dynamic fade used inside dropdowns and select components and many more small and big components that improve user experience.

Besides my primary work, starting 2017, I've joined the team at GirlsGoIT as a mentor at their events. During those boot camps and summer camps, I've been responsible for teaching girls, mostly from high school, the basics of web development, the main scope being an extra boost of motivation for choosing a career in tech.
